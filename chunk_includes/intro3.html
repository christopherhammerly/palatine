<b>Instructions</b>
</p>


<p>
After you have finished reading each sentence, you'll be asked to judge if the sentence <b>you just read</b> is an acceptable sentence of English using a scale from 1-7, where 1 is the least acceptable sentence and 7 is the most acceptable sentence, and 4 is somehwere in the middle. Respond using the number keys, and <b>make sure to use every number available in the scale, even if it feels forced at first</b>. It will begin to feel more natural over the course of the task. 
</p>
<p>
You are NOT being asked to judge the plausibility of the sentence; you are simply being asked to judge whether each sentence sounds like a possible sentence of English. You are also not being asked to judge whether each sentence is acceptable according to a 'school grammar.' As a native speaker of English, you have intuitions or 'gut feelings' about what sounds like an acceptable sentence.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes you may not be sure which answer is correct. When this happens, go with your first instinct, don't over think it! 
</p>
<p>
Throughout the experiment, you should always keep your hands positioned so that the thumb on one hand is pressing the spacebar, and the other hand is selecting a number valuing using the number keys. Remember, please try to press the spacebar fast enough to allow for relatively natural reading of the sentence.
